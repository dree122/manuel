             I am an Informatics student at ST Bhinneka with a strong interest in modern web and application development. Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, and 3D programming with React Three Fiber. I also have experience working with Java Swing for desktop applications and integrating them with MySQL databases. I am enthusiastic about continuously improving my programming skills and building creative, functional projects.
